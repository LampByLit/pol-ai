      "headline": "Vigilante Pedo Hunters Face Backlash",
      "article": "Critics accuse so-called \"pedo hunters\" of targeting vulnerable individuals rather than actual predators. Many argue these vigilantes are \"psychopaths who want an excuse to beat people up,\" focusing on legal or borderline cases like an 18-year-old meeting a 16-year-old. One user claims, \"Almost every single person reading this would fuck a 15yo girl if he could get away with it. We’re wired that way.\" Others allege these groups avoid confronting dangerous offenders, instead preying on \"mentally ill/retarded or simply young guys.\" Some suggest the hunters are state-backed, citing rapid police responses to their stings compared to delayed reactions to violent crimes.",
